 <h2> Handala </h2>
  <img class="displayed3" src="images/handala.png"> 
<p class = "handala">
   In most of Naji al-Ali's cartoons there stands a small boy viewed from 
 the backside. That small boy is Naji al-Ali himself as a child expelled from his Palestinian homeland. Naji named the character Hanzala... which means "bitterness" in Arabic. The artist saw his Hanzala character as a bold witness to history. Naji Al ali says "Handala was born ten years old, and he will always be ten years old. At that age, I left my homeland, and when he returns, Handala will still be ten, and then he will start growing up. The laws of nature do not apply to him. He is unique. Things will become normal again when the homeland returns." Handala, the refugee child who is present in every cartoon, remains a potent symbol of the struggle of the Palestinian people for justice and self-determination.</p>

 <h2> Impact on Revolution </h2>
 <img class="displayed3" src="images/impact.png"> 
 <p>
   More than twenty-five years after his death, Naji Al-Alis cartoons 
 continue to resonate with people in the Middle East, telling stories about the region that remain as true today as they were when he was alive.
 to this day, he is regarded as one of the most influential Arab artists of the 20th century. Naji al-Ali remains a hero in the Arab world, in particular to the Palestinians, who say his name with the same tenderness with which they mention their great poets. His iconic figure, Hanthala, remains a potent Palestinian symbol and will for a long time to come. Unfortunately, with the Middle Easts twin taps of violence and despair still open, there is all too much for Hanthala to see.</p>

 <h2> Book </h2>
 <img class="displayed3" src="images/book.jpg"> 
    <p>
   The pen is mightier than the sword, they say. The Palestinian 
 political cartoonist Naji al-Ali certainly hoped it might be, and once drew a sword with a pen nib at its point. More characteristic of his peculiar genius for symbolism is the drawing used on the cover of this book, <span style="color:rgb(255,255,255)">A Child in Palestine</span>, in which the pen stands upright, its nib doubling as a candle flame. It's a potently simple image, yet complex. </p>
